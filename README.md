=============

My collection of Blender Addons and User Interface Modifications

[Prebuilt collection for Windows x86_64 (Blender 2.79)]

--

Requirements:
--
* For complete Feature set:
* Blender 2.79 Official Build ONLY!!!!
* blenderpython279 zip, unpacked.

Installation:
* Download Blender 2.79 in zip format and extract to the location of your choice.
* Using Blnder 2.79 Zip Version! https://www.blender.org/download/
* Unpack to a location of your choice!
* Browse the folder structure to the \blender-2.79-windows64\2.79 folder.
* Copy/paste the config & scripts folder from blenderpython zip into \blender-2.79-windows64\2.79
* This will overwrite only the files I have updated and add the new folders for addons.

Contents:
* This repo contains many addons and modified Blender ui files.
* All modifications are done via python.

File structure:
* New folders are added for addons:
* addons_custom; I use this folder to put all my paid for addons into.
* addons_extern; I use this folder to put all the addons i collect from the forums and github.
* I acheive access to these folders by modifying the 2.79\scripts\modules\addons_utils.py
* The addons_custom addons show up in user preferences > addons > Community category.
* The addons_extern addons show up in user preferences > addons > Testing category.
* This allows me to copy/paste addons into these folders and keep them organized and easy to keep track of.

User interface Changes:
These are many and varied and rely heaily upon my startup files.
There are combinations of ui changes spread across Blender interface files and with the use of addons.
As your starting with a fresh build of Blender, I suggest to use the start up files in the config folder initially, then File > load factory settings to view the uuser interface without the addons enabled.

more information to come, Files to follow soon.
